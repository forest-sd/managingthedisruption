<section><div class="container"><div class="grid">
<div class="card"><h3>AI & Automation</h3><p>Artificial intelligence and robotics are reshaping every industry. From autonomous vehicles to AI-powered diagnosis, from algorithmic trading to automated customer service, the impact on employment, skills, and economic structure is profound. We examine both the opportunities and the risks of this technological revolution, and what policies and practices can help workers and communities transition successfully.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Workforce Transformation</h3><p>The widespread destruction of both blue-collar and white-collar jobs requires fundamental rethinking of education, training, and social safety nets. We explore models for lifelong learning, portable benefits, universal basic income, and other innovations that can help workers navigate a labor market in constant flux.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Institutional Resilience</h3><p>Governments, corporations, universities, and nonprofits were designed for a slower, more predictable world. Their structures, processes, and cultures often resist the rapid adaptation that current conditions demand. We study organizations that are successfully reinventing themselves and extract principles that others can apply.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Democratic Governance</h3><p>Polarization, misinformation, and declining trust in institutions threaten the foundations of democratic society. Technology amplifies both connection and division. We examine how democratic systems can be strengthened and modernized to remain effective and legitimate in an era of rapid change and information overload.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Economic Inequality</h3><p>Technological disruption tends to concentrate wealth and opportunity among those best positioned to exploit it, while displacing those least prepared to adapt. Without intentional intervention, the gap between winners and losers will continue to widen, threatening social stability and the promise of shared prosperity.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Education & Lifelong Learning</h3><p>Traditional education systems prepare people for careers that may not exist by the time they graduate. We need educational models that teach adaptability, critical thinking, and continuous learning — skills that remain valuable regardless of how technology evolves. We explore what that looks like in practice.</p></div>
