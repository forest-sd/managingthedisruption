<section class="hero"><div class="container"><h1>Thrive in the Face of Change</h1><p>Technological and cultural change no longer evolves at a measured pace. The velocity of disruption is now exponentially greater than at any time in human history. We explore how to adapt, lead, and build resilience in this new reality.</p><a href="/topics/" class="btn">Explore the Issues</a></div></section>
<section><div class="container"><h2>The Challenge of Our Time</h2>
<blockquote>"There is a mismatch between the change in the pace of change and our ability to develop the learning systems, training systems, management systems, social safety nets, and government regulations that would enable citizens to get the most out of these accelerations and cushion their worst impacts." — Thomas Friedman, Thank You for Being Late</blockquote>
<p>Although we all feel the visceral effects of rapid change, what is less evident is an understanding of the limitations of our collective and individual capacity to perceive, understand, and adapt to the disruptions happening around us. The tools, paradigms, worldviews, and strategies that worked in past generations no longer work, and we find ourselves adrift in a sea of dislocation.</p>
<p>Volatility is the new normal. We see the rise of nationalism, populism, and extreme political polarization. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, and robotics continue to advance at lightning speed, disrupting both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. We urgently need new frameworks for understanding and navigating this unprecedented era of transformation.</p>

<section class="alt-bg"><div class="container"><h2>Critical Questions</h2><div class="grid">
<div class="card"><h3>The Adaptation Gap</h3><p>At what point does the gap between the velocity of change and our adaptive capacity become catastrophic? As technology accelerates exponentially while human institutions evolve linearly, we face a widening chasm that threatens social stability and democratic governance.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Social Cohesion</h3><p>At what point is the dislocation caused by this mismatch so extreme, the divisions so pronounced, that the center can no longer hold? Understanding the breaking points of social cohesion is essential for preventing irreversible fragmentation.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Reinventing Institutions</h3><p>What can be done to accelerate our adaptive capacity — to rethink and reinvent our political systems, businesses, educational institutions, and philanthropic organizations so they are truly effective in this emerging future?</p></div>
